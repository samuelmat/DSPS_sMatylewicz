CLARITY: The plot is pretty easy to read. Some of the points, however, are covered up by others. 
The axes all have clear units and the title is staight forward.

AESTHETIC: Since only one dataset is being plotted, it is colorblind friendly. As stated before, there is overlap with the points though.
The scale of the y axis is also a bit busy and crowded. 

HONESTY: The graph appear to be very honest. It is not distorted and there is nothing distracting the viewer.

Suggestions: 
1) Consider increasing the font size and making the y-axis less busy. These will both make the graph easier to read.

2) Consider making the data points transparent. This will solve the problem of overlapping and covering of data points.

3) Consider making a best fit line for the data points. I think a best fit line would be very beneficial for this plot

QUALITY: Overall, the plot is simple, but it does the job. There is nothing distorting the plot or distracting the viewer. 
Everything is very straightforward and clear.
