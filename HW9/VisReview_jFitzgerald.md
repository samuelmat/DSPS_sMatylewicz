* The plot is very clear, no glaring ambiguties.
* The 6 or so points at the bottom of the plot *must* be errors... right? If they aren't, some sort of explanation in a caption or in the readme with the pot would really be necessary. 0 horsepower doesn't make a lot of sense for a 1.5 ton car.
* The axis labels are a bit small for my taste.
* The title is honestly useless - I can already get that information by reading the axis labels.
